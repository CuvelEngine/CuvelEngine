# CuvelEngine
The Cuvel Engine is a learning project started by a group of students that wanted to get knee-deep into the world of volumetric graphics and physics, advanced voxelization of 3D models and real-time interactive simulations. 

## How to run
Every dependency is directly inside of the project so that when you download this repository you have everything you need. You only need VisualStudio 2022 and a GPU that supports OpenGL 4.5 or Vulkan.

## Where will this go?
Who knows!! We don't have a particular scope we want to limit ourselves into. We start small and grow till we feel like there's nothing to add. Who knows where this will lead!!
